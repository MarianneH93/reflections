When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating, or as a backup for your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people might be updating the remote repository. Pulling changes
may interfere with your work.
